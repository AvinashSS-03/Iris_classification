🌸 Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview
This project is a Machine Learning classification model built using the Iris dataset.
It predicts the species of an iris flower based on its physical measurements such as sepal and petal dimensions.
This project was developed to understand how Machine Learning works, including data preparation, model training, prediction, and evaluation.

🎯 Problem Statement

Given the following input features:
Sepal length
Sepal width
Petal length
Petal width
The model predicts the iris flower species:
Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica

🧠 Technologies Used

Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
ML models

📊 Dataset
The Iris dataset is a built-in dataset provided by Scikit-learn.
It contains 150 flower samples with 4 features and 3 target classes.

⚙️ Project Workflow

Load the Iris dataset
Convert the data into a Pandas DataFrame
Split the dataset into training and testing sets
Train a Random Forest Classifier
Accept user input for flower measurements
Predict the flower species
Evaluate the model using accuracy score

📈 Model Performance

Algorithm Used: Random Forest Classifier
Evaluation Metric: Accuracy Score
Model Accuracy: 100% on test data
